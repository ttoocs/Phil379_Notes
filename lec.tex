\begin{proof}[Equinumerous is transitive]
Prove: if $A$ is equinumerous with $B$ and $B$ is equinumerous wit $C$, then $A$ is equinumerous with $C$.
Proof: Suppose $A$ is equinumerous to $B$, and $B$ is equinumerous to $C$. Then:
There is a total,one-to-one function $f$ from $A$ onto $B$, and a total one-to-one function $g$ from $B$ to $C$.
Prove equinumerous via h=g(f), such that h(n)=g(f(n))
\begin{itemize}
\item h is total: Let $a$ be a member of $A$. $h(a) = g(f(a))$. Since f is total there is a member of $b$ of $B$ such that $f(a)=b)$. since $g$ is total, there is a member of $c \in C$ such that $g(b)=c$. Hence, $h$ is total.
\item $h$ is onto $C$. WLOG Let $c$ be a member of $C$, as $g$ is onto, $\exists b \in B$ such that $g(b)=c$. As $f$ is onto, then $\exists a \in A $ such that $f(a)=b$. Hence, the composition of $h=f(g)$ is onto $C$.
\item $h$ is one-to-one: Suppose $h$ is not one-to-one. \\
Then there $\exists a_1,a_2 \in A$ such that $h(a_1)=h(a_2), a_1 \not = a_2$.\\
Giving $g(f(a_1))=g(f(a_2)), a_1 /not = a_2$\\
Since $g$ is one-to-one $g(b_1) = g(b_2)$ iff $b_1=b_2$. \\
So the issue must lie in $f$.  However $f$ is one-to-one $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$ iff $f(a) = f(b)$.
Which is a contradiction, giving us that $h$ is one-to-one.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}


%next lecture:

$A^{n}:$ the $n$th Cartesian product of $A$ with itself.

%%Another lecture of pure joy.

%Remark
Suppose that the set of real Numbers $r, r \lt r \lt 1$, is enumerable.
Then $L_r : r_1,r_2,r_3....$ written in a notation of  $0.n_1 n_2 n_3$.($n being natural numbers$)

%Remark
The set of functions form the set of positive integers to positive integers is not enumerable.
\begin{proof}
Suppose S is enumerable.\\
Then there is a list $L_s$ of the members of $S$.\\
$L_s = \{ s_1,s_2,s_3,\cdots \}$\\
Let $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n \in k \iff n \not \in S_n$\\
$k$ is a set of positive intigers. \\
so There is a number $j$such that $k=s_j$.
So $j \in S_j \iff j \not in S_j$ \\
Hence $S$ is not enumerable. \\
\end{proof}

The set of total nomadic functions from the set of positive integers, $F^{1}$, is not enumerable.

It's a Proof by contradiction. %(I was too lazy to write it down)

%Another lecture.
%We now go into more turing machines stuffs.

Turing machines are in the following form: $q_n, S_{1/0}, S_{1/0}/R/L, q_m$ where $q_n$ is our current state, and you see $S_{1/0}$, perform function $S_{1/0}/R/$ and move to state $q_m$. If there is no operation specified on the current state for a scan, then it halts. (Also Called the Turing Alphabet)

Example with notation:
\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,on grid,auto]
% \tilkzstyle{every state}=[f
  \node[state,initial]  (n)                     {$n$};
  \node[state]          (m)    [right of = n]  {$m$};

%    <inital node> edge   node {label} (node_name)
%   (q)   edge        node {}     ()
%  \path[->]    %%TODO uncomment when PDFLATEX starts working to compile this lable
%    (n)  edge                node { $S_{1/0}:(L/R)$ }    (m);  %This is giving me an infinite compile time??
\end{tikzpicture}\\

ex: (These are the same)
$$Q_1S_1RQ_1,Q_1S_0S_1Q_2,Q_2S_1LQ_2,Q_2S_0RQ_3,Q_3S_1S_0Q_3,Q_3S_0RQ_4$$
\begin{tikzpicture}[shorten >=1pt,node distance=2cm,on grid,auto]
% \tilkzstyle{every state}=[f
  \node[state,initial]  (1)                     {$1$};
  \node[state]          (2)    [right of = 1]   {$2$};
  \node[state]          (3)    [right of = 2]   {$3$};
  \node[state]          (4)    [right of = 3]   {$4$};

%    <inital node> edge   node {label} (node_name)
%ex:   (q)   edge        node {}     ()
  \path[->]
    (1)   edge  [loop above]  node    {1:R}   ()
    (1)   edge                node    {0:1}   (2)
    (2)   edge  [loop above]  node    {1:L}   ()
    (2)   edge                node    {0:R}   (3)
    (3)   edge  [loop above]  node    {1:0}   ()
    (3)   edge                node    {0:R}   (4);
\end{tikzpicture}\\

\begin{remark}[Turing Machines]
\begin{itemize}
\item Each Turing machine is a finite set of Turing instructions.
\item Each instruction is a 4 letter word of the Turing Alphabet.
\item The set of Turing machine is enumerable. (Proof: exercise)
%The set of 1 instruction turing machines is enumerable. (Map them to a two dimentional grid with X being inital states, Y being the final state, and the elements inbetween being the 8 combinations of operations of the two states. Then weave!
%For any n the set of n instruction Turing machines is also enumerbable.
%Use Induction!
%Then show the union of all this is enumerable.

%It could also be done with the number of states being enumerable.
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}

%Another lecture begins!
\begin{definition}[Standard inital configuration]
A turing machine is in a standard Inital configuration $\iff$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item for some positive integer $k$, there are $k$ blocks of $1$'s on the tape. %Either there is just a single block of 1's, or two or three blocks of ones, and so-on
\item seperated by a blank, %a single blank 
\item and the rest of the tape is blank. %or empty.
\item the machine is scanning the left-most $1$ on the tape.
\item the machine is in it's lowest numbered state.
\end{itemize}
ex: $\cdots0010110111000\cdots$ is a $SIC$. (if it's in lowest state)
ex: $\cdots00010000\cdots$ is a $SIC$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Standard final configuration]
A turing machine is in a standard final configuration $\iff$ 
\begin{itemize}
\item there is a single block of $k$ $1$'s
\item and the rest of the tape is blank. 
\item the machine is scanning the left-most $1$ on the tape.
\end{itemize}
ex: $\cdots0010110111000\cdots$ is a $SIC$. (if it's in lowest state)
ex: $\cdots00010000\cdots$ is a $SIC$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Computes a one-place function $f^1$]
A turing $M$ computes a one-place function $f^1$: \\
if $M$ is started in a $SIC$ with a single block of $k$ $1$'s and
\begin{itemize}
\item if $f^1$ is defined for the argument $k$, then $M$ eventually halts in a $SFC$
\item or if $f^1$ is not defined for the argument $k$, then either $M$ never halts or it halts in a non-standard final configuration.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Every turing machine computes exactly one functionof two arguments. %Not really sure the context of this... but eh
\end{remark}
